d-light-box
====

Very light lightbox for Derby.js.

Uses [flexbox](http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox), so not totally compatible with every browser.

May burn houses down etc. Improvements are welcome.

##Usage

```html
<d-lightbox selector="#article img"></d-lightbox>
```

This will apply the lightbox to the elements found by the `selector`.
